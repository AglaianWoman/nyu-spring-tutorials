## Today's Session

### Where to Write Code
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  * For use on your computer only
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
  * Always hosted online
  * Cannot directly work with Github

### HTML

Concepts:
* Opening and closing tags
* What happens if you forget to close a tag

Basic HTML tags:
* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`
* `<title>`
* `<h1>`
* `<p>`
* `<img>`
* `<a>`

Basic HTML template:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello there!
  </body>
</html>

```

Practice:

  * `<h1>`
  * `<h2>`
  * `<h3>`
  * `<p>`
  * `<img>`
  * `<a>`
  * `<ul>`
  * Comments

### Github

__How does Github work exactly?__

Four basic commands to sync the code on our computer to the repository hosted on Github

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Updated design"`
git push
```

Creating 'branches' and using a branch called 'gh-pages' to create our own website

```
git branch
git branch gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

What else is possible? [Github's excellent cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf). They also have a [tutorial](https://try.github.io).
