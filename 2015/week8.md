# Week 8 - Web Scraping
Being able to scrape a website also means that you are able to recognize how web sites are built.

### How Does a Webscraper Work?

We use a script to download all of the HTML that loads when we visit a URL. Then, we look through that HTML, picking and choosing the parts the are interesting to us and saving it. To do this, we need to be able to:

* Identify what part of the HTML we're interested in
* Tell our script what that HTML means
* Save our results somewhere

### Why Scrape?

Many reasons, including...

* Saving yourself the trouble of visiting the same website everyday. Think live results, or daily updating graphics. Or maybe you want to monitor whether or not a website has changed from day to day.
* It's faster to scrape than to manually copy hundreds or thousands or millions of rows of data.
* You can't get the [fill in the blank] office to give you a clean version of the data to download.

### A Different Exercise for HTML/CSS
