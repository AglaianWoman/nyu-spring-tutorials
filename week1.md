### Git vs. Github

__What is Git?__
    * Version control for coders
        * Why do coders need version control?
            * Sometimes your code just breaks and you need to go back
            * Collaboration
            * Think of it like "track changes" or "revision history"

__What is Github?__
    * Graphical web service that helps people use git, plus some other nice features
    * Why would anyone use it?
        - Creators:
            - Version control
            - Collaboration
            - Sharing with the world
            - Free web hosting
            - Project management extras (issues, milestones, etc.)
        - Users:
            - Access open-source projects and libraries
            - Contribute to projects online (pull request)
    * How does Github work exactly?
        - `git status`
        - `git add .`
        - `git commit -m "Updated design"`
        - `git push`
    * Using the Github web interface to make a website from scratch.
        - Create a new HTMl file
        - Create a new branch called gh-pages
